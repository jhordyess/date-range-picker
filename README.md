# Date range picker

Basic date range picker using ReactJS and TailwindCSS.

Use predefined options such as "Last 7 days" or "Last 12 months" with dynamic calendars.

The design is inspired by [Orman Clark's](https://dribbble.com/ormanclark) [Free Date Picker Figma Component](https://dribbble.com/shots/15616759-Free-Date-Picker-Figma-Component/attachments/7406055?mode=media).
